# <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px"> Hi there!

I am _Adrien_, a late starting French PhD student, formerly quantitative researcher, clocking 30 full rotations around the :sun_with_face:. Technically, I make a living by computing integrals, hard ones, but integrals nonetheless. 


### OK, OK, but what do I _really_ do?
I'm generally interested in inference in state-space models. Typically with a flavour of Monte Carlo, and/or parallelisation. See my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sJJ7FKgAAAAJ&hl=en) profile. 
As part of this, I also contribute some personal code, and to some open source libraries. Regarding the latter, I am mostly contributing to [BlackJax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax).


### Where can I find you?
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AdrienCorenflos): I ain't tweet much, but I listen a lot.
- [Email](mailto:i@imnerd.org): typically if you have math/academic questions.
- Github issue: on the repo of your choice.
- Foraging :mushroom:: if you are in Finland in Autumn.
